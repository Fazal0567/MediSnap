- Primary color: Light teal (#A7DBD8) to convey trustworthiness and a connection to health.
- Background color: Off-white (#F8F8F8), almost desaturated teal, for a clean, modern, and accessible appearance.
- Accent color: Pale blue (#B3DDF2), analogous to the teal but with more brightness, used for highlighting important interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, provides both a modern look and a little warmth, and works for both headlines and body text.
- Use clear, easily recognizable icons to represent different functions and categories within the app.
